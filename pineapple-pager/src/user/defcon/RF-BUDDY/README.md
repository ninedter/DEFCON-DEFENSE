# RF-BUDDY

A passive 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz interference finder for the WiFi Pineapple Pager.
Carry it around the office and watch the readings move: walking toward a
problem makes the score rise, walking away makes it fall. It never transmits.

## What it measures

The Pager's monitor radio cannot report channel busy time or a noise floor, so
RF-BUDDY measures what it can hear directly:

- **Airtime %** — how much of the channel is taken up by Wi-Fi frames.
- **Retry %** — how many frames are retransmissions. Lots of retries on a channel
  that is not busy usually means radio interference.
- **APs** — networks on the channel, plus 2.4 GHz networks on overlapping channels.
- **Bluetooth** — nearby BLE devices (earbuds, watches, phones), counted with a
  passive scan that never transmits.

## Screens and buttons

**Overview** — one bar per channel (airtime %, coloured by score: green < 40,
amber 40–69, red ≥ 70). The right panel shows the selected channel's score,
airtime, retry %, AP count, frames per second, and the likely cause.

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| LEFT / RIGHT | select channel |
| UP / DOWN | cycle tabs: 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz / BT |
| A | lock on to the selected channel |
| B | exit |

**Lock-on** — the radio stays on one channel and updates once a second: big
score, trend, peak, a 60-second graph, the strongest transmitters, and the
nearby Bluetooth count. The buzzer tick plays faster as the score rises.

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| LEFT / RIGHT | move to the neighbouring channel |
| UP | tick on/off |
| A | MARK SPOT — writes a numbered marker to the log |
| B | back to the overview |

**BT tab** — nearby Bluetooth LE devices, browsed in three levels: BRANDS
(Apple, Samsung, Bose, JBL/Harman, Tile, Realtek, ... UNKNOWN collects devices that nothing identifies),
then the TYPES of that brand (Find My, Nearby, AirPlay, ...), then the DEVICES of
that type, strongest first; each device row shows its advertised name, or its
address when it has none. The right panel summarises the highlighted row; at
the device level it shows nine rows: ADDR, ADDR TYPE, MAKER, KIND, NAME,
SIGNAL (`-64 (PK -61)`: now and peak), ADV/S, TX PWR and SEEN (`0S / 04:08:25`:
seconds since the last advert and the time it was first seen). MAKER is the
brand (or the registered maker name when only a bare `ID XXXX` is known); KIND
is the decoded model (for example AIRPODS PRO 2 or WINDOWS LAPTOP) or else the
type; NAME falls back to the beacon summary (IBEACON 100/7, EDDYSTONE UID).
Anything unknown, including a signal or peak with no data, shows `--`. At the
type level a SERVICES line lists the standard Bluetooth services (for example
HEART RATE) advertised by the strongest device.

ADDR TYPE tells how much to trust the address:

- `PUBLIC` — the fixed address burned in by the maker; its first three bytes
  identify the maker.
- `STATIC` — random, but constant until the device reboots.
- `PRIVATE` — random and rotating (privacy address, as phones and earbuds use),
  so the same device shows up under several addresses.
- `NON-RESOLV` — random and short-lived, never resolvable by a paired peer.

### How devices are identified

Passive adverts only, matched offline against a database embedded in the
payload (no network needed). The brand is the first hit of: Bluetooth SIG
company ID (also tried byte-swapped), SIG member service UUID (for example
Tile, Google), keyword in the advertised name, IEEE OUI of a **PUBLIC**
address only (a random address says nothing about the maker), first word of
the name, a brand hinted by a service UUID, an `ID XXXX` placeholder for an unregistered company ID, else
UNKNOWN. The kind is the first hit of: maker-specific decoding (Apple proximity
pairing models, iBeacon, Microsoft CDP device type, Eddystone), name keyword,
standard SIG services, SIG appearance, else OTHER.

To regenerate the database (Bluetooth SIG assigned numbers and the Wireshark
`manuf` file are downloaded once; the build never needs the network):

```sh
cd pineapple-pager
python3 tools/gen_btdb.py --download --src /tmp/btsrc --out src/user/defcon/RF-BUDDY/ui/btdb
```

Data sources: Bluetooth SIG assigned numbers (company identifiers, member and
service UUIDs, appearance values) and the IEEE OUI registry via the Wireshark
`manuf` file. Source URLs and download date are in `ui/btdb/SOURCES.md`.

| Button | Brands | Types | Devices |
|---|---|---|---|
| LEFT / RIGHT | previous / next brand | previous / next type | previous / next device |
| UP / DOWN | cycle tabs: 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz / BT | previous / next type | previous / next device |
| A | open the brand's types | open the type's devices | TRACK the device |
| B | exit | back to brands | back to types |

**BT track** — a walk-around proximity meter for one device: big signal
strength with VERY CLOSE / CLOSE / NEAR / FAR, closer/farther trend, peak, a
60-second graph, and which Wi-Fi channels BLE advertising overlaps. The buzzer
tick speeds up as you get closer.

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| LEFT / RIGHT | track the previous / next device of the same brand and type |
| UP | tick on/off |
| A | MARK SPOT — writes a numbered marker to the log |
| B | back to the device list |

BT marks go in `marks.csv` as `n,epoch,bt,ADDRESS,RSSI,LABEL` (the channel
column holds the device address, the score column its signal in dBm).

## Likely causes

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| INTERFERENCE | many retries while the channel is not busy — typical of microwaves, wireless cameras, or heavy Bluetooth |
| CONGESTION | Wi-Fi is using most of the channel's airtime |
| CHANNEL OVERLAP | a loud AP on a neighbouring 2.4 GHz channel (e.g. 4 next to 6) |
| BT DENSE | many Bluetooth LE devices nearby — a common cause of earbud static |
| WEAK COVERAGE | your office AP is quiet here (needs `OFFICE_SSID`) |
| CLEAN | nothing notable |

## Setup

Edit the CONFIG block at the top of `payload.sh`:

- `OFFICE_SSID` — your office network name. Enables `WEAK COVERAGE`.
- `TICK_FREQ_HZ` — pitch of the lock-on tick on the Pager buzzer (default 2000).
- `TICK_VOLUME` — loudness of the tick, 0-100 (default 60).
- Thresholds (`RETRY_HIGH_PCT`, `AIRTIME_HIGH_PCT`, …) are documented inline.

Recon keeps running while RF-BUDDY is open; it is locked to one channel at a
time and returns to normal hopping when you exit. The Bluetooth scan is passive.

## Viewer and the stock UI

Open **http://172.16.52.1:1474** for RF-BUDDY's own viewer: a live copy of the
screen with on-page buttons. The viewer has no login, so it listens only on the
Pager's USB management address (`172.16.52.1`), never on a Wi-Fi network the
Pager has joined. Buttons only work from the viewer's own on-page buttons (or
keyboard keys); direct cross-site requests are refused.

While RF-BUDDY runs, the stock Pager menu and the stock Virtual Pager (`:1471`)
are paused; they return when you press B. RF-BUDDY also takes over the power
button (it is on the same input device), so pressing **power** on any screen
exits RF-BUDDY cleanly and hands the button back to the Pager — then use the
Pager's Power Menu → **Shutdown** to turn it off.

### If the Pager menu stays frozen

RF-BUDDY's watchdog resumes the stock menu if RF-BUDDY is killed. If the
RF-BUDDY app itself hangs, holding the power button until the Pager cuts power
is the last resort; expect the unclean-shutdown warning on the next boot.

## Logs

Each run writes `/root/loot/rf_buddy/<date-time>/`:

- `samples.csv` — one row per channel per sweep, one row per second in lock-on
  (`score` is the raw score, so spikes are kept).
- `marks.csv` — your MARK SPOT markers.
- `session.txt` — what the radio supported and the settings used.

Retrieve them with Virtual Pager → **Download Loot** (after RF-BUDDY has exited and the stock Virtual Pager is back).
